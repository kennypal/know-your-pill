### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Find an API that suits for this web application
- Construct an HTML to show what the application is all about and where the user will input the pill's information (imprint, color, shape)
- Apply JavaScript to give results based on user's information
- Add style to the application to make it presentable
- Apply responsive design to the application

#### PostMVP  

- Add a second API to show brand vs generic names of the medication
- Add a pill organizer/calendar on the web application
- Add a section where they can put the information of the pharmacy they go to
